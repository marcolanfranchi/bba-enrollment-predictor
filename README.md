## BBA Enrollment Predictor

Warm-up project for BUS 439 - Analytics Project. 

<!-- Our pipeline includes data cleaning, pre-processing, and model training. Given a course name, its term, and a student's relevant information (for students who are eligible for the course), the final model is capable of predicting whether or not a student will enroll in a future upper-division BBA course.

Our model is useful for estimating course demand, identifying potentially over- or under-enrolled courses, and supporting academic planning decisions such as scheduling, capacity planning, and resource allocation. -->
